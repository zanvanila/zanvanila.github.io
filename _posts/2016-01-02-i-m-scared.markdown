I'm scared ya Allah
I feel devastated
why do u give us so much
do we need to give more
is that ur intention
this is a test right?
how grateful are we
how greedy are we
how unthoughtful are we
I don't want to have so much
that I'm comfortable with what I have
and not thinking about others
u are the greatest of giver
why shouldn't I do the same?
there are a lot of other people in need out there
even Rasulullah live poorly
how can I live so comfortably
they may be poor in property
but they are rich at heart
I'm scared
of which
when we are so rich on the outside
but we are so poor on the inside
deceived by the beautiful worldly life we are
I'm scared
so just give me enough
more for my heart
less for my possession
may Allah hear this thought 
because I know the questions
that will be ask soon after we die
where u spend ur lifetime
where u spent ur youth
where u spent ur property 
where u spent ur knowledge
I want to give a good answer for evry each of those questions
and get a good mark
and get good rewards
and get mesmerizing paradise
and of course ur rahmat wa redha
in sha Allah
ease this resolution
for we don't want to be like qarun
whose the slave of his property
that was a sign
for us all
so beware
appreciate this nikmah
appreciate this rezeki
by giving more
in sha Allahu taala
